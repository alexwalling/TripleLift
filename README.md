Coding challenge for TripleLift Internship

###Problem
Design a reusable form component

###Solution
I implemented a form component that adds to a list elements entered into the text field.
To delete elements in the list you can click on the word to remove it. If you would rather just start the entire form over you can click "clear list" to clear the entire list.
For the form submit I used a javascript alert to alert you that the form has been submitted but this could be changed to any submit you like.
I did some styling of the form for my implementation but this could be changed with a new css file and styling.
